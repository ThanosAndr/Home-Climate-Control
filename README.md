# Project Title

Home Climate Control using Arduino Yun

## Getting Started

This project was build as a project for "Sensors & Applicatons" course at National Technical University of Athens.

The main objective of the project is to automate the use of an AC unit by measuring the inside and outside temprature in order make the change of climate, when leaving or entering the house, be less stressful to the human body

## Deployment

In order to recreate this project you will need all the hardware used or parts with similar functionality, a Temboo account and the libraries described in the [HomeClimateControl.pdf](HomeClimateControl.pdf)
